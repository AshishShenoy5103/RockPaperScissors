Rock Paper Scissors Game using Random Integer Generator in Java
This is a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors, implemented in Java using a random integer generator. The game allows the user to play against the computer and keeps track of the score throughout multiple rounds.

How to Play
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your Java IDE of choice.
Run the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose Rock, Paper or Scissors.
The computer will make a random selection as well.
The winner of the round will be displayed.
The game will continue for a set number of rounds.
At the end of the game, the final score will be displayed.
Technical Details
The game is implemented using Java programming language and uses a random integer generator to simulate the computer's choice. The user's input is taken through the standard input (System.in) and validated using conditional statements.

The game allows the user to play multiple rounds and keeps track of the score using variables. At the end of the game, the final score is displayed using the standard output (System.out).

Future Improvements
There are several areas where this game could be improved, such as:

Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more user-friendly.
Allowing the user to select the number of rounds they want to play.
Adding more options for the user to choose from (e.g. lizard, Spock, etc.).
Implementing a more advanced algorithm for the computer's selection (e.g. machine learning).
Conclusion
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, using a random integer generator in Java. It is a fun and educational exercise for beginners to learn about conditional statements and basic game development.
